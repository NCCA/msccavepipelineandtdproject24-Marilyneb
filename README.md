# Web-based 3D Model Library

This project is a web-based application that allows users to upload, view, and interact with 3D models. The goal is to create a local, searchable 3D model library, similar to Sketchfab, but with the ability to read from a local SQLite database.

## Plan

- Backend Development with Python and Flask

-  Qt for Web (Qt for WebAssembly)

- SQLite as the database

- Docker for containerization

- Users: Can upload and view 3D models.

- Assets: 3D models uploaded by users.

- Tags: Labels that can be attached to assets to facilitate searching.

## Tasks

- Set up the server with Python and Flask
            frontend with Qt for WebAssembly
            database with SQLite

- Implement user registration and login
            asset upload
            tagging for assets
            search by tag
            asset viewing
- Dockerize
